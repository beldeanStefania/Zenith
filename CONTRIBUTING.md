## Contributing guideline

When creating a new feature, create a new branch and use format feature/featureName. Ex: feature/createUserModel

Mention the issue name in the commit comment. Ex: "ZNTH-11 create the user model"

Use camelCase for methods and variables. Ex: int userAge, void calculatePrice()

Use PascalCase for classes and interfaces. Ex: class UserController, interface PaymentService

The name of the tests should be: should[Action]When[Condition]. Ex: shouldThrowExceptionWhenAccountAdminIsNotFound()
